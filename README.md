# Welcome to My World
###### Here is my safe zone where I allow myself to learn and fail continuously until I get there.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am @Siri-RTNP. 
- ðŸ’• I relocated across countries to be with my life partner and start over in life.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in learning computer languages, human languages (EN, DE, TH, CN), and arts.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning HTML,CSS,JavaScript and many more to become a front-end web developer.

``` I am open to collaborating on any projects that provide good contributions to society ```
