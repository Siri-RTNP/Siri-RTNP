### 😊 Welcome ! It means something that you are here today .. 
#### 🕹️ Here is my safe space where I allow myself to learn and to fail as parts of my learning process.

I am a generation WHY who has experienced floppy disks, 56k modems and dump phones. I learn programming out of my childhood's curiosity and aim to understand how things work behind the scence after being a user for decades. 

Because learning is fascinating! I believe in life-long learning and believe that everyone has their own pace. It is a matter of knowing it now or do not know it yet, wanting to know or do not want to know. 

**und natürlich Übung macht den Meister ! (Practice makes perfect)**
>I believe my small actions daily would lead to life changing experience someday and learning is not a competition in school system. It is fun when sharing with others. I enjoy learning computer languages, as well as human languages. ```(EN, DE, TH, CN)```


🌱 I am proud of myself that I grow a little more and am still breathing each day.
