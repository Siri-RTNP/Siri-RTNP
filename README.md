### Welcome ! It means something that you are here today ..
###### Here is my safe zone where I allow myself to learn and fail repeatedly as parts of my learning journey

I am interested in learning computer languages and human languages (EN, DE, TH, CN).

I am proud of myself that I grow a little more each day. ðŸŒ± 

My motto today:
``` If I can learn German, I can learn programming. If I can learn programming, I can learn German. ```
